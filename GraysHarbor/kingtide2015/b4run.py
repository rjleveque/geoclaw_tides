"""
Sample b4run.py file.  If a file  like this is in the rundir directory 
used by runclaw.py (e.g. the application directory from which you
execute 'make .output') this will be executed after creating the
outdir and before running the Clawpack code.

If no b4run.py file is found in the rundir then the environment variable
B4RUN, if set, is used to locate a file used more globally, e.g. you could
set this to point to $HOME/b4ruon.py for a default version to use if there
is no local version, or you can use this version by setting B4RUN to
$CLAW/clawutil/src/python/clawutil/b4run.py

Use this, for example, to copy any files you want to the outdir,
either because they are needed for the run or to archive them along
with the output.

This sample version copies the Makefile and any Python or Fortran codes.

It also creates (or appends to) a runlog.txt file containing information 
about this run: the rundir and the time/date the run started.

Adapt this file to your own needs.
