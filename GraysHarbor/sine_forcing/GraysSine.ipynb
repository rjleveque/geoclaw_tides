The tide at Westport lags the ocean tide by about 2743 seconds and is amplified relative to the specified ocean tide.  The tide at Aberdeen lags by about 3820 seconds and is further amplified.\n",

    "- The time lag between high tide at Westport and Aberdeen is about $3820-2743 = 1077$ seconds (18 minutes), which agrees well with observations (need to confirm!).\n",

    "- At Westport the amplifcation factor is approximate 1.1 (it is greater for the high tide and less for the low tide).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Given an observed tide at Westport that we want to match, we can shift it by about 2743 seconds and diminish it by a factor 1.1 in order to obtain the $\\eta_o(t)$ to use for forcing the ocean.  This is illustrated in the example `geoclaw_tides/grays_kingtide2015`.\n"
