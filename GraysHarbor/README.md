# GraysHarbor

This directory contains code to simulate tides in Grays Harbor, WA.

See [GraysSine.ipynb](sine_forcing/GraysSine.html) for some
discussion of the approach used to force the tide.

## `topo` directory

Use [GraysHarborMTL.ipynb](topo/GraysHarborMTL.html) to download 1/3 arcsecond
topography data that is referenced to MHW and adjust it so that it is 
more closely aligned with Mean Tide Level (MTL). Since we are modeling
the tide, we want to use topography referenced to MTL if possible.

Use `fetch_etopo.py` to download 1 arcminute topography of the coastal
region from the etopo1 database.

## `sine_forcing` directory

In this directory tidal forcing is applied to force the ocean to have a
pure sine wave oscillation with amplitude 1. Examining the resulting gauge
time series at the Westport gauge allows us to determine how much this wave
is amplified and the time lag between the ocean forcing and the response
at Westport.  See [GraysSine.ipynb](sine_forcing/GraysSine.html) for 
this determination.

## `kingtide2015` directory

Simulates the King Tide event from December, 2015.  
The notebook [GraysKingTide.ipynb](kingtide2015/GraysKingTide.html) 
downloads observations at the Westport and Aberdeen tide gauges and adjusts 
the Westport data to obtain the forcing function to be applied in the ocean.
After running GeoClaw with this input, the same notebook shows the
resulting simulated tides compared to the observations.
